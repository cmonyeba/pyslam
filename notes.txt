PROJECTION MATRIX (EDIT: camera matrix or (camera) projection matrix)
    It is a 3x4 matrix that takes 3D coordinates and is able to project them onto the 2D plane of the camera
    The projection matrix (P) is the dot product of the intrinsic and extirinsic matrix of the camera.

INTRINSIC MATRIX ((ALSO KNOWN AS THE CAMERA MATRIX I BELIEVE))
    It is an 3x3 matrix that descirbe the geometric property of the camera
    The intrinsic matrix (K) is information about the camera such as focal length and optical center

    K = [[f_x s x_0][0 f_y y_0][0 0 1]]


    Focal length is the distance from the pinhole to the image plane. It is measured in pixels.

    f_x and f_y ideally should be the same but may differ in practice due to flaws in camera/sensor/image

    x_0 and y_0 are known as Principle Point Offset. 

    The camera's 'principle axis' is the line perpendicular to the image plane and passes though the pinhole.
    The point where the 'principle axis' passes through the image plane is know as the 'principle point'.

    The Principle Point Offset is the location of the principle point in relation to the image plane origin which can
    be assumed to be (0,0) or bottom left of the image.

    Axis Skew is s.
    
EXTRINSIC MATRIX
    The extirinsic matrix (R|t) is a 3x3 Rotation matrix (R) stacked with a 3x1 Translation Vector (t)

TRIANGULATE 
    Known Projection Matrix of Camera 1 and 2 and corresponding matching coordinates y_1 y_2

    Create a Homogeneous Linear Equation and solve for the unknown vector (3D point) using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)




############### IDEAS ################
- Finding the Rotation matrix and Translation vector at each postion will give the pose.
- Extrinsic matrix is useful for knowing orentation of camera to calculate 3D points from.
- Intrinsic matrix doesnt change. Set attributes from the camera. Will affect Projection matrix.
